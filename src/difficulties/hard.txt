As you can see in the title this is A very hard typing test text. Someone must have the worldwide record as at least 60 seconds to he put up on my typing test wall! I will be checking this page every day to see if someone got this score. Most likely I will! Me! It's very fun making these types of elaborate things because you can write whatever you want! And input commonly mispeled words! As you probably noticed by now, that mistake was on purpose. Or was it? Do your best! I will do my best. Believe in yourself. This thing is gonna repeat for hours. And hours. I'm just eating food while typing this thing up. It's ;like my 900 word essay that was required to pass one of my language arts classes! It sucked.
